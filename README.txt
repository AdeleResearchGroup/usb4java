usb4java - USB library for Java based on libusb-0.1.x
Copyright (C) 2011 Klaus Reimer <k@ailis.de>

==============================================================================

This library can be used to access USB devices in Java. It is based on the 
native libusb-0.1.x shared library and reflects this API as complete as 
possible. usb4java also implements the javax.usb (JSR80) API. So you can choose 
if you want to access the USB devices via the low-level libusb-0.1.x API or 
via the high level javax.usb API.

The native libraries are included in pre-compiled form for Linux, Windows and
Mac OS X in 32 and 64 bit versions. The libraries are automatically extracted
and loaded so you don't need to care about them.
