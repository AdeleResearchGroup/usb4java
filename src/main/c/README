This is the source code of the JNI wrapper for libusb. usb4java
already includes pre-compiled libraries for the following platforms:

* linux-x86
* linux-x86_64
* linux-arm
* windows-x86
* windows-x86_64
* osx-x86
* osx-x86_64

If you need the library on an other platform then you can easily compile it
yourself. On a Unix-compatible operating system you only need the Java JDK,
the libusb(x) library version 1.0.16 or higher and the GNU C compiler. 
When everything is correctly installed then you should be able to build the 
library with the following commands:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  
When compilation was successful then you can find the library in the
`src/.libs` directory. Rename the file so it doesn't include any version
number (Examples: libusb4java.so, libusb4java.dylib, libusb4java.dll).

usb4java searches for the library in the CLASSPATH directory
`de/ailis/usb4java/libusb/<OS>-<ARCH>/`. On a 32 bit x86 linux machine for
example the directory name is `de/ailis/usb4java/libusb/linux-x86`. Usually
you can find the required name in the exception thrown by usb4java when it
does not find the required library.
