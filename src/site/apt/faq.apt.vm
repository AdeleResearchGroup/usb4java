* I can't open my USB device on Linux. Why?

  On Linux you need write permissions on the device file of the USB device
  you want to communicate with. Check if the devices are accessible when
  running your program as root. If this works then it is recommended to
  configure <udev> to give your user write permissions when the device
  is attached. You can do this by creating a file like
  </lib/etc/udev/rules.d/99-userusbdevices.rules> with content like this:

----
  SUBSYSTEM=="usb",ATTR{idVendor}=="89ab",ATTR{idProduct}=="4567",MODE="0660",GROUP="wheel"
----

  This means that whenever a USB device with vendor id <0x89ab> and product id
  <0x4567> is attached then the group <wheel> is permitted to
  write to the device. So make sure your user is in that group (or use a
  different group).
  
  If your device uses a shared vendor/product id then you might want to
  filter for the manufacturer and product name. This can be done by checking
  the ATTR properties <idVendor> and <idProduct>.
  
  To activate this new configuration you may need to re-attach the USB device.

* I can't open my USB device on Windows. Why?

  On Windows you need to create a driver for your USB device. Read the
  {{{https://github.com/libusb/libusb/wiki/Windows#wiki-How_to_use_libusb_on_Windows}How to use libusb on Windows}} 
  article from the  {{{http://libusb.info}libusb project}} for more information.
