Configuration

  To tell the USB Host Manager of <javax.usb> to use the <usb4java>
  implementation you have to put the following property into the
  <javax.usb.properties> file which must be located in the root of
  your classpath:
  
+----+
javax.usb.services = de.ailis.usb4java.Services
+----+ 

  <usb4java> can be configured by adding more properties to this file as
  described in the following sections. All these properties only affect
  the high-level <javax.usb> API of <usb4java>. The low-level API just wraps
  the native <libusb> library so no configuration is available (or needed) for
  it.

  
* Communication timeout

  The default USB communication timeout of <usb4java> is 2500 milliseconds.
  To change this to 250 milliseconds for example add this to the properties
  file: 
  
+----+
de.ailis.usb4java.timeout = 250
+----+
