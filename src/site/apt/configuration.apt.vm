Configuration

  To tell the USB Host Manager of <javax.usb> to use the <usb4java>
  implementation you have to put the following property into the
  <javax.usb.properties> file which must be located in the root of
  your classpath:
  
+----+
javax.usb.services = de.ailis.usb4java.Services
+----+ 

  <usb4java> can be configured by adding more properties to this file as
  described in the following sections. All these properties only affect
  the high-level <javax.usb> API of <usb4java>. The low-level API just wraps
  the native <libusb> library so no configuration is available (or needed) for
  it.

  
* Communication timeout

  The default USB communication timeout of <usb4java> is 2500 milliseconds.
  To change this to 250 milliseconds for example add this to the properties
  file: 
  
+----+
de.ailis.usb4java.timeout = 250
+----+


* Scan interval

  The default USB device scan interval of <usb4java> is 500 milliseconds. To
  change this to 1000 milliseconds for example add this to the properties file:

+----+
de.ailis.usb4java.scanInterval = 1000
+----+

  When you set this interval to 0 then <usb4java> only scans once during
  application startup. If you want to trigger a manual device <scan> you can
  do it by calling the scan method on the USB services class (Must be casted
  to the <usb4java> implementation, because this is not a javax.usb feature:

+----+
((de.ailis.usb4java.Services) UsbHostManager.getUsbServices()).scan();
+----+
