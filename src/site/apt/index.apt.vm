What is usb4java?

  usb4java is a Java library to access USB devices. The low-level part is
  based on the native {{{http://www.libusb.org/}libusb 0.1}} shared library
  and reflects this API as complete as possible. Java NIO buffers are used
  for data exchange between libusb and Java. The high-level part implements
  the {{{http://www.java-usb.org/}javax.usb standard (JSR-80)}} but this part
  is not well tested at the moment.
  
  Supported platforms are Linux (Intel 32/64 bit), Mac OS X (Intel 32/64 bit,
  PowerPC 32 bit) and Windows (Intel 32/64 bit). But other platforms may work
  as well (as long as they have Java 6 and are supported by libusb) by
  compiling the JNI library manually. 
  
  For Windows the libusb port of the
  {{{http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/libusb-win32/wiki}libusb-win32}} project
  is used and you need to create and install a driver for the USB device you
  want to use with usb4java (Instructions can be found on the libusb-win32
  website).
