API design

  The API of usb4java closely follows the C API of the
  {{{http://libusb.info/}libusb}} project.  All global functions and
  constants of <libusb> are defined as static members of the class
  {{{./apidocs/org/usb4java/LibUsb.html}org.usb4java.LibUsb}}. 
  All structures of <libusb> are defined in separate classes which are named
  similar to the original struct names but without underscores, with upper
  case names and with the <libusb> prefix removed.  For example the struct
  <libusb_device_handle> is defined in the class
  {{{./apidocs/org/usb4java/DeviceHandle.html}DeviceHandle}}.  Struct
  members are represented by static methods in the corresponding class.
   
  The following notable differences exists between the <libusb 1.0 API> and
  the <usb4java> API:
    
  * <interface> in the configuration descriptor is named <iface> because
    <interface> is a reserved word in Java.
    
  * <MaxPower> in the configuration descriptor is named <bMaxPower> to
    be compatible to the USB specification and because method names starting
    with upper-case letters are quite unusual in Java.
    
  * Whenever libusb expects a byte pointer and a length you have to use
    a direct Java NIO ByteBuffer instead.
    
  * Methods which are returning a string through a byte buffer which was
    passed as argument have additional simplified overloaded method
    equivalents which are returning a Java String directly.
    
  []

* Initialization/deinitialization

  Before using any usb4java functionality you must initialize libusb:
  
----
final Context context = new Context();
int result = LibUsb.init(context);
if (result < 0) throw new RuntimeException("Unable to initialize libusb. Result=" + result);
----

  Specifiying a context is optional. If your application only needs a single
  libusb context then you can specify <null> as context.
  
  Before your application terminates you should deinitialize libusb:

----  
LibUsb.exit(context);
----
